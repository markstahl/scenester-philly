# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.3.2

* Data is seeded. Run rails db:seed to load data into React components.

* Rails db:migrate

* Uses MapBox API with React components, getting a new access key is advised.

* Deployment is as easy as loading the database. Everything else is good to go.
